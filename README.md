<h1>FM Version 2.0</h1>
<p>Version 2.0 keeps the .mp4 as well as extracts .mp3</p>
<p>*NOTICE*: For those without FFmpeg installed on their computer, this will still work for downloading single 
videos. An error will be shown in the terminal and tell the user to install FFmpeg, this is only neccessary if you want FM_2.0 to automatically extract the .mp3 into a separate file. Otherwise, ignore the warning and 
an .mp4 file should be saved to the root folder from where FM_2.0 is opened unless specified to save elsewhere
in the options fields.

<p>Works great with single files or whole playlists.</p>
